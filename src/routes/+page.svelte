<p>
  My name is Tristen, I am a senior Software Engineering major at RIT. I
  currently specialize in automation and full-stack web development. I have
  interned for M&T Bank two Summers in a row (2024/2025), and have been a
  full-stack intern for Innovative Systems (Fall 2025). I am currently interning
  at Benco Dental as a frontend dev intern on their internal applications team,
  and will be interning again at M&T Bank this Summer (2026). Currently looking
  for full-time oppportunities as I graduate in Fall 2026! 👀
